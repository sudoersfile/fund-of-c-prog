## Compiling instructions

To build, run and test the program, open the terminal and type in one of
the following commands:

```shell
$ make         # Compile the program
$ make run     # Compile and run the program
$ make test    # Test the program (not yet configured)
$ make clean   # Removes all files in the `./bin` and `./out` folders
```

As you can tell, this program uses `make` to compile the program. Make sure
sure have it installed if you want to compile it on your own computer.
