# 48430 Fundamental of C Programming â€“ Assignment 3

A text encryption, decryption and compression program for Assignment 3 in
Fundamentals of C Programming.

## Subject details

  * Lab 03 (4pm-6pm Monday)
  * Group 03

## Group members

  * Hugh James Seagrave Hannan (13193204)
  * Mohammed Ta-Seen Islam (13215660)

## Compiling instructions

To build, run and test the program, open the terminal and type in one of
the following commands:

```shell
$ make         # Compile the program
$ make run     # Compile and run the program
$ make test    # Test the program (not yet configured)
$ make clean   # Removes all files in the `./bin` and `./out` folders
```

As you can tell, this program uses `make` to compile the program. Make sure
sure have it installed if you want to compile it on your own computer.

## What we could achieve:

Before next week we need to write an outline describing what we plan to do and
how we plan to do it. We also need to write out all the main functions we plain
to implement into our program as well as more or less finish one or two of them.

## What we couldn't achieve:

*TODO*
